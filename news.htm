          tw o   kinds of lights: halogen and xenon lights. 
          Halogen lamp produced in the 20th century, 6
          0  years, which is filled with halogen gas into th
          e bulb, both to reduce the consumption of tun
          gstencan also maintain the brightness of the b
          ulb o extend the life of the lamp. At present, th
          evast majority of domestic cars and some old i

          <h3>The rise of LED lights</h3>
          <p>With the continuous progress of society, peop
          le's awareness of the environment and resourc
          es more and more strong, low-carbon, energy 
          saving, emission reduction, new energy has be
          come the most popular topic, new energy vehi
          cleswerencluded in China's thirteen five plan O
          f the key projects. LED lights power consumpti
          on is small, fast response and other characterist
          csconform to this trend. LED taillights, car lights
          and other low-power products in the automoti
          v application has been very mature, and as a hi
          h-power headlights, early two years has also br

          he HID competition core is still HID electronic 
          ballast, that is often said that the ballast. Most 
          of the HID electronic ballasts currently on the 
          market are still semi-digital semi-simulated sol
          utions, and some even the whole simulation s
          olution, and the real damage to the bulb is sm
          all, bright and stable lighting, to achieve the tr
          ue sense Long life, high stability of the pure di
          gital electronic ballasts very few. Some manuf
          acturers in order to reduce costs for the marke

          at the use of some of the old demolition of the
